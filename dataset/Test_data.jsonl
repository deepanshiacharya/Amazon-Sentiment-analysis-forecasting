PRECISE ... for lack of a better word ... and I can't quite explain how amazing it is using bits like this compared to cheaper brands other than to say that the difference is absolutely noticeable... you wont strip a head on a screw EVER with these bits as long as you're using the right one for the job. And they have longevity ... after three years of hard daily use on my last set, they still worked as good as they did on the first day.<br /><br />Do you pay ten bucks more for this set over the generic crap?

Highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Here are the pros and cons:<br />+ can be used for CD/Vent mount, I prefer CD which fits my car better, it is very sturdy<br />+ charger has bottom support that can be adjusted to fit phones with different size from 4.7in up to 7in.<br />+ the charger has an internal battery that powers the arm to auto clamp the phone (tightly) when sensing its presence. opening the arms can be done through side buttons which is handy. I used these features for >20 times and find it is very convenient<br />+ wireless charging works on my iPhone 8p with case. I think there may be an issue if your case is too thick<br />+ charging is fast with QC3.0 car charger. It even works with regular 5V/2A charger. I have both of them working. when charging, I can see battery percentage going up by several points just after ~10 min charging.<br />- wish it comes with a QC3 car charger so I don't have to buy one by myself<br /><br />One thing to note, when the car is hot like in the afternoon, iPhone itself has a thermal protection mechanism that may limit the wireless charging to protect the battery.

Its way better than 5X and reviews in amazon, google were compelling.<br />1. Phone is faster than the 5X and similar to LeEco and ZTE brands. I researched them in walmart and stores nearby.<br />2. Camera is decent, poor light is a problem, but ok for a limited use.<br />3. Battery is ok, per my use, a full day is good so that I can charge by the night. But charging is as usual rate, wish they had the dash faster charging.<br />4. Screen and speed of apps acceptable over WiFi. I like wider screens so that you can view a little larger font, without much eye strain..<br />5. Huawei is a decent brand, I see lots of phone these days,<br />6. I wanted memory slot to hold more photos and music. Now I have an unlimited supply, 64 GB card slot.<br />7. I wanted Wifi Calling, but TMobile doesnt provide it for now.<br /><br />Why 4 stars ?<br />1. At almost the same price, ZTE provides better audio and a bit better hardware.<br />2. 12 MP camera, Zooming in some of the pics were not so good, ZTE offered 16 MP.<br />3. Battery non removable.<br />Definitely 5 stars if the same phone was sold about $40-$50 less.", "rating": 4, "title": "Good phone, but a touch pricy.", "asin": "B01MT13NNB", "user_id": "AFVGA5SXRQ7INF47H5QCUBWRPDZA", "timestamp": "2018-04-03T21:03:14", "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true, "year": 2018, "rid": "e328f73f3a2d8014cd31d42c878e2a71743ae1e0dcb00ffedc3b5257b31f27cc", "label": ["1"], "Comments": []}

{"id": 1879, "text": "I'd love to give this a 5 star rating, but the issues with stand and the buttons knock it down to a 3, however, it does protect these stupidly expensive phones as advertised.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this case to anyone but I would caution them about the side buttons and little plastic stand vulnerability. It gets 5 stars for protection but 3 stars for features...I'd rate this 4 stars without the side buttons issue (read below).<br /><br />Pros: I love how thin this case is, its comfortable in any pocket. The wireless charging works perfectly with this case with all three of my different brand charging bases. The back of the case is textured and almost rubber like making it easy to hang on to and doesn't get greasy or slippery.<br /><br />The main reasons for a 3 star rating are:<br /><br />1. While the buttons on the side are great because they are actual buttons, every time I get in the car I always put my phone in the cup holder and sometimes it's upside down and when it's upside down the sides of the cupholder push the all 3 side buttons. On the iPhone X if the lock button and either volume button are pushed and held at the same time, the shutdown screen pops up and gives you the option to either turn off the phone, call SOS/911, or if the buttons are held for 5 seconds with no action on your part it automatically calls SOS/911. To date, my phone has called the police 6 times and i've had the pleasure of getting to know my local police dispatcher explaining there is no emergency (the last time a patrol car drove by the house). If the buttons weren't really buttons but molded into the case and/or were little more difficult to push (like other cases i've had) I don't think this would be an issue.<br /><br />2. The first drop with the case installed and the little plastic stand on the back broke off. Again, this case would get 4 stars because it protected the phone with zero damage from the drop (was waist high and bounced off the dining room chair leg) but the button issue is too much. I bought this case because of the slim fit, the advertised protection, the stand was a bonus feature but now with it broken off there's a &#34;hole&#34; in the back of the case where the stand folded into and that's annoying. I'd be willing to have this replaced rather than buying another case but I won't be taking it off until I decide on a new case. The times I've used the phone on the airplane tray table I needed to put a napkin underneath it to keep it from sliding around since the stand and the sides are plastic. If the stand had a rubber coating and/or the sides had the same textured coating as the back there would be no issue sliding off the tray table.<br /><br />3. The side of the case provides great protection because it's thick but I cannot get to the silent switch because it is too deep. I have to use my car key, charger, pen, whatever is close or flex the case back and forth until the switch flips.", "rating": 3, "title": "Slim, Protective Case.

{"id": 1936, "text": "This mount looks well built.  My experience with it: it works loose and crawls out of the cup holder over time.  It's easy to put back in place but not when you're driving.  I use it in a Toyota RAV4 and a Tacoma pickup.  It holds the phone well and the height is just about right.  The mount has 3 tabs that extend out with a twist of a ring on top to squeeze it into the cup holder.  The tabs are plastic and there are rubber covers that extend the tabs if the cup holder is very wide.  I don't know if you can get replacements if you misplace one.  It may be a better fit in other vehicles.<br /><br />After using for almost a year here's an update:  This thing doesn't like temperature extremes.  In the Spring, I found that it can be tight at night and in the morning loose enough to fall over.  One morning I came out to the car and it was laying in pieces.

{"id": 530, "text": "This was perfection! About a week ago, I sat on the floor at work without realizing my phone was in my butt pocket and I heard a &quot;crunch&quot; sound. Not thinking much of it, I went about my business until later I needed to check my phone when I noticed my back camera lens had a perfectly cracked hole in it. (Apparently my phone charm fell on the lens when I put it in my pocket, and when I sat down..... well thats what made the sound when I sat.)<br />Desperate to not have to go back to Verizon to get it fixed, which reading online ranges from $200+, I did some research and that's when I read that you can replace the camera lens by yourself. So after reading Amazon reviews I decided to purchase this particular set. I received the set yesterday and decided to do the cosmetic surgery this morning and let me tell you what a hell of a difference! I had asked Amazon reviewers if you had to open the up the actual system, remove the back cover from the front cover and do it that way. But the Amazon reviewer said you didn't have to open your phone at all. With this said, I turned off my phone, ready to operate. This set is included with very fine tweezers so I took my time removing little shards of glass before I was able to rip off the entire adhesive holding the rest of the glass together. (Btw, I strongly advise you to wear eye protection because it's possible to pull the broken camera lens and have a small shard fly....... into..... your eye.) The adhesive pretty much removed in one or two pullings and I was able to clean up the rest of the lens of extra shards that have fallen through. I would take the fine tweezers and kind of rotate the camera with them to see if I could hear crunching sounds. If I did I knew that tiny little shards of glass were still wedged where the camera lens was, and it wouldn't be able to properly adjust itself when zooming in or zooming out. So after I cleaned it out as much as I could I took the little microfiber cloth and cleaned the top of it as best as I could. Then I carefully took the film off the adhesive camera lens, used the pliers again and carefully placed it above the camera, (where its supposed to go) and firmly, but gently, pressed it into place. After that I turn back on my phone and went straight to the camera app. I took a couple of photos around my room and kind of did notice my phone was having trouble zooming in so turned on &quot;HDR&quot; mode in the camera settings and now the thing zooms in quite beautifully. In fact it's like I never had this problem to begin with. So thank you Yuyond for selling this product. You saved me some hard earned dough and it's so easy.

{"id": 482, "text": "I’m editing my review as I’m now ordering my THIRD kit.  A few minutes ago my wife tripped over our Lab andfell, landing on some rocks.  She had her phone in her hand, landing screen down.  She had no idea I had put a screen protector on her phone and pointed to the sharp impact point and spider web of broken glass.  I pulled the badly broken protector off and zero damage to her overpriced iPhone!  Thank you!<br /><br /> This was my second purchase of this screen protector.  Within a week of my last purchase and application I put a nice, deep scratch in the protector.  That was a win for saving my screen!  I noticed my “selfie” camera was becoming blurry so I decided I would order a new protector.  It arrived and I hadn’t yet applied it to the phone.  Today, I dropped the phone from a 1 story roof, landing on gravel, I found what I thought was the screen shattered.  Instead it was just the protector!  It absorbed the impact, saved the screen and the phone itself.  I highly recommend this product!

While the case is smooth I don’t feel like it is slippery. I’ve actually dropped my phone less since switching to this style, than when I had the slim and tough armor. This particular style feels better in my hand. I have a glass screen cover on my phone and it hasn’t affected that. The port holes and buttons are all perfectly aligned. There are two small holes in the bottom corners on the back that another reviewer mentioned, but I’m assuming they are here for a reason. The case isn’t meant to be waterproof or anything. Overall, highly recommend this brand and style.", "rating": 5, "title": "Love the brand and style", "asin": "B01M0USRWG", "user_id": "AHECE6ONCPEZUKJE5KFKR5JMOSRA", "timestamp": "2018-03-07T03:53:29", "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true, "year": 2018, "rid": "389be9c34910effdb7296b9d337240e7493c54e94b6ae10a8d7906f5e6c25c3d", "Comments": [], "label": ["1"]}

It's not as thick as my last case but feels solid enough and provides ample protection. Raised lip to protect the screen, nice texture back with plenty of grip and perfect fit with all cutouts at the right spot.<br />The crime button and textured back looks really nice and not as cheap as my last case. The only problem with this case is the buttons. The buttons stick out past the case and it's really easy to accidentally hit them.
