{"id":811,"text":"Doesn't ring loud enough to be heard in an outside city environment and vibrate is weak as well, resulting in missed calls. Even worse, when you do miss a call because of this, it doesn't even notify you. You have to actually go into your Call Log > Missed Calls to find out!  I missed several delivery calls and had to constantly check the call log to make sure I didn't miss any more. On my old A392G, missed call notifications would be right on the screen superseding all other functions. When I tried to switch back to my A392G, it wouldn't let me because the sim card expired even though it was working 2 days ago before I bought the myflip. Fortunately customer service is sending me a new sim card so I can use my old phone again. Also to find your balance on the myflip, you must text 611611 and type in balance and then you get messaged back with your balance. On the old A392G, it was just right on the front screen as soon as you open it. The My Flip has a bunch of extra bells and whistles for wifi, but they really missed the whole point in designing this phone. People who get a flip phone are looking for simplicity and easy functionality, this seriously fails in ease of use and practical use in any environment that isn't very quiet. They tried to pack a bunch of smartphone features into a phone that should instead serve as a simple alternative for people who just want to make calls, text, and be able to hear it outdoors. Can't wait to get my old A392G phone reactivated and return the myflip and get my money back.","rid":"ab3a7633508071c590d2403b53f25913c9ac3c7d9fe2ccc3176fbd389f55b362","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.998760581,"neutral_prob":0.0004034407,"positive_prob":0.0008358847,"confidence_score":0.998760581,"entropy":0.0148823559,"uncertainty_score":0.0018812906,"entities":[{"id":772,"label":"-1","start_offset":0,"end_offset":1535}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

It shouldn‚Äôt matter what kind of AC power adapter I am using, you should reach 100% charged after sitting on the charger all night.","rid":"24310c445509753de09c304fc32739201696511ac2fa5ecaa2aec0d90bf5e5a7","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.9980698228,"neutral_prob":0.0006893449,"positive_prob":0.0012408469,"confidence_score":0.9980698228,"entropy":0.0220015068,"uncertainty_score":0.0029313953,"entities":[{"id":759,"label":"-1","start_offset":0,"end_offset":680}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":2128,"text":"Updated a few days after info below...  I sent a question out to other purchasers about their experience with the battery. Got a variety of responses, mostly helpful. After tweaking lots of settings and turning off notifications for everything except text messages and email, I've seen serious improvement.  Went to bed last night with phone charged to 100%;  got up this morning to battery at 97%. That's better.<br \/><br \/>Initial review comments: The battery in this $100 phone is pure crap. I can literally watch it go down after sending a few text messages or browsing my FB feed for 5-10 minutes. I replaced a Tracfone LG whose keyboard wasn't working (it mysteriously started working again when the new phone was activated) and the LG's  battery was not holding a charge as it was 3 years old. This new phone's battery actually goes down FASTER than my old phone's 3-year old battery. I thought Samsung was a step-up, but I've wasted $100 on a phone that cannot be depended on since the battery goes down so quickly. I don't blame Amazon... this is a obviously a Samsung issue. As soon as I can afford it, I'll be forced to shop for a new, more dependable phone.  Update from previous info...  Went to bed with battery charged to 100%. Got up and it was at 62%. Seriously? I've turned off everything I know to do to conserve battery.  Suggestions welcome on other possible fixes.","rid":"22ddcfff860ae740ec659abc5b6fd7a660ecbfa21ff128fd25d0a91c18a62c5d","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.9994779229,"neutral_prob":0.000001981,"positive_prob":0.0005201349,"confidence_score":0.9994779229,"entropy":0.0064645908,"uncertainty_score":0.0007907727,"label":["-1"],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1111,"text":"This product is quit expensive but very easy to install. You don't have to worry about getting the cut hole for the camera or finger scanner. Using the template case and watch the video everything just went smoothly. There was no bubble no dust trap inside and the finger scanner work too. I love it so far.<br \/><br \/>One of the problem I experienced is the enhensive(glue) after finish installing. There will be glue sticking out of the edge and it's very hard to remove. I did not notice at first but dust keep collecting at the edge and this make the screen look very dirty like I have been using it for months. So i give it my full attention and start to clean it but become even more messy. The more I try to clean it the more it will spread. It was to the point I need to clean it with soup. My hand was sticky and the phone was sticky, I can see my finger print everywhere on the phone. I did what I can to clean everything and start looking great.<br \/><br \/>Why I did all this to remove all the glue from the edge?  It's because it will collect more dust over time and life will find their way inside the screen protector. Then it will start to pill off.<br \/><br \/>May 22, 2019<br \/>Been using for maybe a month and a few weeks. And I noticed that this screen protector is very fragile and extremely easy to break it.

I remember I did this slowly and being very careful. Then I noticed five minutes later, some small grible manage to crack it?

{"id":1114,"text":"The big benefits of this battery pack  is that it is substantially smaller and lighter then previous 10 amp hour battery packs I have used .<br \/><br \/> And yes the proper rating is 10 amp hours not 10,000 milliamp hours..<br \/><br \/>Rating a battery pack of this capacity in milliamp hours is nothing more than marketing Hype to make you think you're getting more than you're actually getting..<br \/><br \/>It would be no different than going to the gas station and buying your Gasoline by the ounce rather than the gallon, why not ? 128 Oz sounds like a lot more than one gallon.<br \/><br \/> Or how about paying your mortgage payment in pennies instead of dollars.<br \/><br \/>  Seriously if we're going to let marketing departments get away with this sort of thing then we might as well get rid of minutes, hours days, weeks and years and just use clocks, and calendars that reads in just seconds, that way instead of  24 hours days 86,400 second days, how many seconds in a year again.<br \/><br \/>Anyhow you get my point there's a reason why we have decimal conversion.<br \/><br \/>Once again the thing I like most about this battery is its size and weight as compared to similar 10 amp hour capacity battery packs I have.<br \/><br \/> As for durability and reliability we've been using it for a few weeks now and have had no problems with it.<br \/><br \/>For those of you who are interested I'm an Electronics Tech, I have a full Electronics lab that I use for repairing Radio Electronics  and Avionics, since I have the necessary equipment I went ahead and measured this battery packs capacity. According to my laboratory grade equipment the pack is close to 10 amp hours which is its rated capacity. You may think this is a given but I have measured other battery packs that were nowhere near their rated capacity.<br \/><br \/>I advise ignoring the reviews from people who claim that just pack charges slower than other similar size battery packs.  I have tested this battery pack against several other 10 amp hour battery packs and they all charge at about the same rate.<br \/><br \/>Keep in mind this does not support QC 3.0 fast charging in fact I don't think any portable pack does so it will take longer to charge your phone or tablet then say a plug-in charger that supports QC 3.0.<br \/><br \/>If you look at the pictures I uploaded you can clearly see that it charges at the same rate as other similarly sized battery pack. The other pack I'm comparing it against in the photos is also a 10:00 amp hour battery pack but it's also about 50% larger yet they both charge at the same rate<br \/><br \/>I'm knocking one star off because the LEDs are very small and very difficult to see especially outside.<br \/><br \/>I do like the fact that it has a USB C charge port.<br \/><br \/>With that said its small size outweighs the fact that it has such tiny LEDs as such I wouldn't have a problem recommending it or even buying another one myself.<br \/><br \/>------- edit 7-22-19 --------<br \/>The Amazon App cropped the original pictures I uploaded which made them pretty much worthless. So I went ahead and cropped the images so you can actually see the readings on the USB battery tester.<br \/>I also corrected some spelling errors in cleaned up the grammar so it was easier to read.","rid":"b43803a28928b28bee4f0db7d33c28b8bb2e62b6ca70b738d15ced90e25e8a58","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.9984076619,"neutral_prob":0.0004315673,"positive_prob":0.0011607737,"confidence_score":0.9984076619,"entropy":0.0184378922,"uncertainty_score":0.0024178054,"label":["-1"],"Comments":[]}

{"id":950,"text":"I will preface my review by saying this: the packaging for this product is very nice, and the tools included are sufficient and effective at completing the ridiculous task of replacing the battery in your iPhone. The battery works fine and wears evenly...HOWEVER, it does NOT last nearly as long as the original battery did from full charge to full discharge. I'm shocked to hear that people are claiming this battery will last &#34;all day, with heavy use&#34;. No way! I've only used my phone lightly each day since replacing the old battery with this one, and it's needed a mid-day recharge several times after only an hour or less of normal use (using news or weather apps, Facebook, etc.). Even at the end of its life, the old (original) battery would hold a charge longer initially before taking a dive after heavy use. If I get a year out of this new battery, I'll be happy enough, because it is a good value at it's current price of $23 and change. But it is clearly not as good of quality as the original unit.<br \/><br \/>On a side note, the instructions (and especially the YouTube video) put out by Scandi Tech are very helpful in completing the job of replacing the battery. That being said, I am rather technically and mechanically inclined, and while this wasn't an overly difficult task for me, I wouldn't call it &#34;easy&#34;. In fact, it was a pain in the a$$. If you have any doubts about whether you can do this job, then DON'T. I had to use a hair dryer six times to apply heat in order to pry out the old battery. It bent to the point where it was at a 45 degree angle all the way top to bottom, just from all the prying. Apple is ridiculous for designing their products this way. Even if a trained technician can do it four times faster, that doesn't mean its &#34;easy&#34;. And of course if you have a 5S like me, you get the extra privilege of having to dance around the extra cable and connection for the home button. Trying to get that set back in place while closing the phone back up and the screen in your way sucks. No two ways about it.

{"id":2312,"text":"Overall, this is a mediocre phone.  I use Google Fi and although I bought this to replace a Nexus 5 that died, it generally performs no better than that phone with a few exceptions.  The underlying technical components screen, sound, and camera, are all better as you would expect.  But as a product and user design is much worse.  One example is that the phone keeps going on mute during calls.  It unintentionally mutes about once every 20 to 30 minutes of conversation.  I'm not sure if I'm somehow activating mute by myself or if its just a bug, and at this point I don't even care: either way its a broken user design that should have been screened out.  Another failure is that often time I plug it in to charge and it looks like its charging but its not.  So I wake up in the morning and need to leave only to find out that my phone is dead or has 15% left.  The lighting bolt icon is still on, but it's not actually charging.  I've found that I can avoid this if I restart the phone after I plug it in which is a hassle that I now have to deal with.  Also, calls on this phone are lousy quality and constantly getting dropped, but that's probably the fault of Google Fi.  Definitely don't spend a lot of this phone because it isn't worth it at all.  Personally, I wish I had just gotten my Nexus 5 repaired because this phone hasn't been worth it.","rid":"e32a035c0c7ce9ded2861fceeadead41bb712e114e1e95a035fea8535b9a464c","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.9999401569,"neutral_prob":0.00000671,"positive_prob":0.0000531497,"confidence_score":0.9999401569,"entropy":0.0009563462,"uncertainty_score":0.0000916702,"label":["-1"],"Comments":[]}
{"id":2313,"text":"Waited a while to post my review in order to get practical use out of the product. I gave it 3 stars for two reasons. 1. For the model that charges the watch and phone there are no lights for each device to indicate whether it is charging or not. There is only a single light that stays red regardless if the device is at 100% or not. 2. I have an iPhone X and if I place the phone on it without a case it gradually slides off of the charger. I'm assuming this is due to poor material quality for the ring that is supposed to provide a type of slip resistance for the phone. None of my phone cases work with wireless charging all that well so I have to take them off to charge the phone. Other than those flaws it works well with charging both of my devices.","rid":"adb2ee799ccaa9880cbe282eb10084df5c6f4f9dd1dd8568dc93c089503552ba","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.9999502897,"neutral_prob":0.0000034221,"positive_prob":0.0000461918,"confidence_score":0.9999502897,"entropy":0.0007991011,"uncertainty_score":0.0000761484,"label":["-1"],"Comments":[]}

{"id":2324,"text":"I bought this same pack at Costco (less exp), but am confused at the light indicators. We use one for the Galaxy 9S+ and another for the iPhone 8 (also see my brief question in Questions). With each pad, when the phone is placed on it, it charges for a few seconds, the light indicator blinks green, then it starts blinking red. I don't know if this is normal behavior.  With the Galaxy, it was at 50% and we decided to just use the USB cable to charge it. When it was at 97%, tried the pad and again, and as before, when it changed to red blinky, a brief message appeared on the phone saying charging had paused. A while later the phone would beep and start charging again for only a few seconds (and I'm talking like 3 or less), and repeat and never get past 97%.<br \/><br \/>With the iPhone (@75%), at first it would do exactly the same, but without any paused message, but then the pad's charging light stopped illuminating altogether; however, every 5 minutes or so, the phone would would beep and show it was charging, but again, after 3 or so seconds stop charging. It never got past 75%, and the pad indicator light never went on again. This would repeat until I decided to try something else.<br \/><br \/>I next took the iPhone and checked battery settings. There is a new feature on the latest iOS (13) for battery health. Under Battery>Battery Health I turned off \"Optimized Battery Charging.\" Then I placed the phone back on the pad and although it did the green light\/red light thing, it did stay on the red blinking light without turning off and without the phone beeping every time charging started. After about 15 minutes, I checked and it had gone from 75% to 78%. So in spite of it being red blinking, it was somewhere in that time charging. I tried that again, and did notice it was switching back and forth from green blinking to red blinking every few seconds without the phone beeping during that time.<br \/><br \/>If this is to do it on the Galaxy, however, the Galaxy beeps each time the pad blinks green again. That will not be conducive to a good night's sleep.<br \/><br \/>If anyone knows anything about the behavior and if this is normal, I'd really love to know!","rid":"9fa30db497b3736a3775e8f6c1b7ce902e7b24f8d6c0c395826ecf5e45c4521e","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.5102211237,"neutral_prob":0.0000005906,"positive_prob":0.4897782803,"confidence_score":0.5102211237,"entropy":0.9997110367,"uncertainty_score":0.750264883,"label":["-1"],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1111,"text":"This product is quit expensive but very easy to install. You don't have to worry about getting the cut hole for the camera or finger scanner. Using the template case and watch the video everything just went smoothly. There was no bubble no dust trap inside and the finger scanner work too. I love it so far.<br \/><br \/>One of the problem I experienced is the enhensive(glue) after finish installing. There will be glue sticking out of the edge and it's very hard to remove. I did not notice at first but dust keep collecting at the edge and this make the screen look very dirty like I have been using it for months. So i give it my full attention and start to clean it but become even more messy. The more I try to clean it the more it will spread. It was to the point I need to clean it with soup. My hand was sticky and the phone was sticky, I can see my finger print everywhere on the phone. I did what I can to clean everything and start looking great.<br \/><br \/>Why I did all this to remove all the glue from the edge?  It's because it will collect more dust over time and life will find their way inside the screen protector. Then it will start to pill off.<br \/><br \/>May 22, 2019<br \/>Been using for maybe a month and a few weeks. And I noticed that this screen protector is very fragile and extremely easy to break it. I already damaged the screen protector twice now. First one was when I try to put my phone face down on the floor and drop it around a few centimeters off the ground. I remember I did this slowly and being very careful. Then I noticed five minutes later, some small grible manage to crack it? Wtf!!!<br \/><br \/>Update on the finger scanner<br \/>With the screen protector it doesn't perform will at all. Its making it harder to use and not convenient to the point I need to switch to face scanner.","rid":"90bda80546b2b674028b6a43c837ef3c09c2c24eb31c0182ab7fedc9fa4618cf","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.4436713159,"neutral_prob":0.3295376897,"positive_prob":0.2267910242,"confidence_score":0.4436713159,"entropy":1.5333869457,"uncertainty_score":0.8457393646,"label":["0"],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1114,"text":"The big benefits of this battery pack  is that it is substantially smaller and lighter then previous 10 amp hour battery packs I have used .<br \/><br \/> And yes the proper rating is 10 amp hours not 10,000 milliamp hours..<br \/><br \/>Rating a battery pack of this capacity in milliamp hours is nothing more than marketing Hype to make you think you're getting more than you're actually getting..<br \/><br \/>It would be no different than going to the gas station and buying your Gasoline by the ounce rather than the gallon, why not ? 128 Oz sounds like a lot more than one gallon.<br \/><br \/> Or how about paying your mortgage payment in pennies instead of dollars.<br \/><br \/>  Seriously if we're going to let marketing departments get away with this sort of thing then we might as well get rid of minutes, hours days, weeks and years and just use clocks, and calendars that reads in just seconds, that way instead of  24 hours days 86,400 second days, how many seconds in a year again.<br \/><br \/>Anyhow you get my point there's a reason why we have decimal conversion.<br \/><br \/>Once again the thing I like most about this battery is its size and weight as compared to similar 10 amp hour capacity battery packs I have.<br \/><br \/> As for durability and reliability we've been using it for a few weeks now and have had no problems with it.<br \/><br \/>For those of you who are interested I'm an Electronics Tech, I have a full Electronics lab that I use for repairing Radio Electronics  and Avionics, since I have the necessary equipment I went ahead and measured this battery packs capacity. According to my laboratory grade equipment the pack is close to 10 amp hours which is its rated capacity. You may think this is a given but I have measured other battery packs that were nowhere near their rated capacity.<br \/><br \/>I advise ignoring the reviews from people who claim that just pack charges slower than other similar size battery packs.  I have tested this battery pack against several other 10 amp hour battery packs and they all charge at about the same rate.<br \/><br \/>Keep in mind this does not support QC 3.0 fast charging in fact I don't think any portable pack does so it will take longer to charge your phone or tablet then say a plug-in charger that supports QC 3.0.<br \/><br \/>If you look at the pictures I uploaded you can clearly see that it charges at the same rate as other similarly sized battery pack. The other pack I'm comparing it against in the photos is also a 10:00 amp hour battery pack but it's also about 50% larger yet they both charge at the same rate<br \/><br \/>I'm knocking one star off because the LEDs are very small and very difficult to see especially outside.<br \/><br \/>I do like the fact that it has a USB C charge port.<br \/><br \/>With that said its small size outweighs the fact that it has such tiny LEDs as such I wouldn't have a problem recommending it or even buying another one myself.<br \/><br \/>------- edit 7-22-19 --------<br \/>The Amazon App cropped the original pictures I uploaded which made them pretty much worthless. So I went ahead and cropped the images so you can actually see the readings on the USB battery tester.<br \/>I also corrected some spelling errors in cleaned up the grammar so it was easier to read.","rid":"b43803a28928b28bee4f0db7d33c28b8bb2e62b6ca70b738d15ced90e25e8a58","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.9984076619,"neutral_prob":0.0004315673,"positive_prob":0.0011607737,"confidence_score":0.9984076619,"entropy":0.0184378922,"uncertainty_score":0.0024178054,"label":["-1"],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1719,"text":"I tried using this clip one lens. Here's the pros and cons:<br \/><br \/>PROS: It does take a nice wide shot. *Assuming that the lens stay focused.* Easier to do it when you're not doing it through selfie mode.<br \/><br \/>CONS: 1. The lens tends to refocus. 2. You have to remove the case of your phone no matter how slim that is or the lens won't properly position. Which is a big deal for me cause I'm kinda clumsy and I'm not comfortable using my phone naked. Not a problem when using face camera though. 3. I had few videos and pictures that I took using the front camera and they came out blurry when I reviewed them. :\/  You can make the lens focus prior taking a selfie but as soon as you change the distance, it just refocuses again and won't refocus unless you tap the phone again. Which makes you pull the phone closer and tap it again to refocus. Doesn't always the case but the lens is not consistent.<br \/><br \/>So, I'm returning it.

The cable is too heavy and unwieldy to take with me when I go places.  They don't roll up easily into compact loops to stick in a pocket of my bag, and really don't want to unroll without taking time to smooth them out before use.  See in the photo I rolled on up and the wire is so stiff it stays rolled up. Also, if you need to roll the cable into compact loops the built-in cable management thingy will not snap because it is designed to hold only a few loops and the snap connection itself will only hold a few loops.  As the cable comes, looped into long loops so the leather snap thing fits, the loops are 10 inches long.","rid":"4566b96d12c1c998ded7cbc921b0b682f37cca23781a4b052aa80754f2e3e10c","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.4020457864,"neutral_prob":0.2410188913,"positive_prob":0.3569352627,"confidence_score":0.4020457864,"entropy":1.5537765026,"uncertainty_score":0.9159726501,"label":["1"],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1337,"text":"Update: This is my third update on this product. I bought three of them, keeping two for myself and giving one to a friend to use with her MacBook. Hers died within a few months. I have used my two for traveling (one for a backup) for a couple of years. One of them died a few days ago, after two years, but since I only use them for traveling this is not really a lot of use (probably 2-3 months continuous). I am going to try another similar product listed on Amazon in hopes of longer life. In any case, I would recommend having a backup lest you be stranded with a dead charger.<br \/><br \/>Update: This is my second update on this product. Used it on a trip overseas. Worked fine on 240V outlet and also charged my friend's Macbook when her charger died. Meanwhile, another charger I was using came apart. This is the smallest charger I've found, has a great guarantee, seller is great to work with, and the fact that you use your own USB-C cable (needs to be a high speed cable) means that if anything goes wrong with the cable, you can just replace it.<br \/><br \/>Update: After my original one star review (narrative below) the vendor contacted me, advised that they had updated the description to include the fact that it doesn't come with a cable, and encouraged me to buy another one. I did so and also bought a WGGE METAL USB C 3.1 Type-C to USB C 3.1 Type-C Cable Nylon braiding Fast Charger here on Amazon. I let my Lenovo Carbon X1 go down to 50% battery and plugged this charger in. It charged my laptop to 97% in 57 minutes. It also charged my Galaxy S9 rapidly. It's the smallest charger I've seen aside from my Dart charger, but Dart seems to be endlessly out of stock.  For now, with a very brief test, I'm giving it four stars considering its very small size and low cost. I plan to use it heavily to see how it does over time.<br \/><br \/>Two notes:<br \/><br \/>I intentionally purchased a cable advertised as being appropriate for high-speed charging. Cables lacking that capability may not work.<br \/><br \/>This charger runs very hot, which is perhaps not surprising given the size, but I will be interested to see how it does on 240v when traveling.<br \/><br \/>Original review:<br \/><br \/>This would be a great travel charger, if it worked. Very small, though the build is pretty cheap. The listing indicates a cable is included. There was none in my box. Borrowed a cable and tried to charge my Lenovo X1 Carbon. Didn't work. Tried to charge my Samsung Galaxy S9. Didn't work. Seems possible that a better cable than I borrowed is needed for it to work properly, but since a cable wasn't included, no way of knowing.","rid":"efd9fa70b7752fc6507c09cab31bb3188186f105b9e666dac9cc9b984ad11094","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.9999907017,"neutral_prob":0.0000033204,"positive_prob":0.0000060147,"confidence_score":0.9999907017,"entropy":0.0001781559,"uncertainty_score":0.0000139928,"label":["-1"],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1351,"text":"I tried to like this product, I really did. They seemed a little off-kilter, when I took them out the package, but I held out a ray of hope that it would straighten out once I got them on. I put the first one on and it was just tragic. It was stretched out of shape on the sides where the buttons go, so you can't make it stay in place. I took that one off and try to put another one on. Again, same problem and sadly, I had the same result with the third one. I have no choice but to return these. One of the things that I liked about them which influence my decision to purchase was that it was matte black, and not the glossy black.","rid":"48826c8fa917944f1dceac7fea8c9f43a55d07adb695184d2805df458a4c2958","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.9999796152,"neutral_prob":0.0000007303,"positive_prob":0.0000197212,"confidence_score":0.9999796152,"entropy":0.000352533,"uncertainty_score":0.0000306766,"label":["0"],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1241,"text":"I have always wanted one of these mounts but I've heard the metal piece that attaches to your phone can interfere with the wireless charging coil that is in the back of the phone. But I saw that this should work with the iPhone X so I decided to see for myself. Well, it works great. I just had to install the metal plate at the bottom of my phone. I used the rectangle plate and lined it up with the bottom of the phone and it sticks really well on the mount and doesn't interfere with charging at all, and the phone is in a case so you don't see the metal plate, which looks really bad on the white glass of my phone.<br \/><br \/>The mount itself secures itself on the vent by using a type of wingnut or thumbscrew that you turn to clamp down tight. It works on anything from a very thin vent to something about 1\/4 inch thick, so you have a lot of options. If your vent isn't going to work, they've also provided a stick on mount with extra sticky pads that you can mount on your dash, center console, or whatever works best for you.<br \/><br \/>Even with the plate being mounted at the bottom of my phone, it sticks to it pretty well even when taking turns fairly hard (I don't recommend doing this, but I wanted to test to see if it would move or fall off). I don't know that this would be recommended for track use, as it probably would move or fly off with enough G forces. But for normal driving, it's fine. I did notice that it moved a little in landscape mode, but that's because of where I put the metal plate. In portrait mode, it didn't move at all.<br \/><br \/>This kit comes with a round plate and a metal plate. Both work well, and you can attach them to 2 different phones to share the mount if different people use your car. There are no instructions included, but it's easy enough to figure out how to mount everything. Overall quality of this mount is good, the rubber on the mount helps protect your phone if you don't use a case. Definitely an above average product and very good for the price.","rid":"dd5cd8934175829231816879bbeb0822b01c368894c41625a62bd1512e08abbd","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.9999537468,"neutral_prob":0.0000106694,"positive_prob":0.0000355696,"confidence_score":0.9999537468,"entropy":0.0007686251,"uncertainty_score":0.0000696054,"entities":[{"id":1255,"label":"1","start_offset":0,"end_offset":2013}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":1242,"text":"Tried to use this in a 2011 Honda Pilot.  The vent louvers have a slight arc in the front and are straight in the back.  We have previously tried the jaw-type Wiz Gear holder and this was never a very good solution because the only place there was enough tension was at the very tip due to the jaw hinge geometry (touch the pad of your thumb to the pad of your 1st finger and look at it from the side -- same geometry as the jaw-type mount).  Eventually, having it tight enough to stay in place, caused one of the arms to break.<br \/>When searching for a replacement, I found this vice-type mechanism and was excited that it would solve the problem in our previous device.  However, after receiving it, I found that there is a small tooth at the end that is meant to trap the back edge of the louver.  I our application, the tooth could not reach the back of the louver because of the arched design.  The tooth prevented the arms from closing completely and adequately gripping the louver -- or so I thought -- so I filed it off.  The arms still wouldn't close all the way so again, this device is unable to provide enough friction with the vent louver to stay in place.<br \/>The company sent the standard Amazon follow-up email -- 'hey, thanks for your purchase! if you like it, leave a review, if you had a problem, reply to let us know so we can help.'  Well, I sent them a reply stating it wasn't what we hoped and isn't working for us.  No response.<br \/>Otherwise, the device is rather large and heavy on its own so if you can't get a tight fit, it's bound to flop around even in the absence of an attached smart phone.  In the plus column, the magnets are strong and when my phone flies off during a turn, the magnet stays attached!","rid":"a4d480d86f001c6a9d4569aa1643855e5c2ad7669a2a91d9ff7299a8fff99097","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.4791245759,"neutral_prob":0.0810529515,"positive_prob":0.4398223758,"confidence_score":0.4791245759,"entropy":1.32361269,"uncertainty_score":0.7838541865,"entities":[{"id":1132,"label":"-1","start_offset":0,"end_offset":1739}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":2426,"text":"I picked this Nanami model due to the aesthetic and stand-type wireless charging for a competitive price relative to other brands, including Anker and Samsung. It is definitely affected by magnets, even thin ones like the one about 1mm thick that's stuck on the back of my 1-piece case. It prevents it from charging and flashes as the instructions warn it may, so I have to remove the case to charge, which is simple enough and my choice to leave the magnet on there that proves very useful in my vehicles when on the road. Anyway, the charger otherwise works fine but will NOT I repeat NOT Fast Charge using the stock Samsung AC adapter. This isn't stated in the product description regarding the Note 9 specifically but many other Samsungs are listed where this issue exists. Fortunately, we've had a few LG phones which have bulkier, heftier AC adapters, so in swapping out to one of those, the Nanami fast charging works just fine with the Note 9. Without that though, the charging is very slow with a stock Samsung adapter, so I would make sure you have that issue addressed before or when buying this wireless charger so as to make full use of its functionality. It otherwise is solid without being too heavy and seems sturdy and looks very sharp and clean on my office desk.

{"id":2432,"text":"I got this phone for my wife who had been using a 5+ year old Windows Phone that has been obsolete for years. Like me, she is a \"senior citizen.\" She is not a frequent smartphone user but has been using an Android tablet daily for over a year to read our local newspaper electronically. I looked for an Android smartphone which would receive regular software updates (especially security updates), which had a 5\" to 5.5\" screen & at least 32GB of storage, and which would not break the bank. The Nokia 6.1, with AndroidOne, checked all the boxes, especially with Amazon's reduced pricing for the black version. AndroidOne updated to Pie (version 9) within a day of being turned on and set up. I moved the (prepaid) H2O Wireless SIM from her Windows Phone to this phone, which required a cut-down from a standard to a nano SIM. (There are devices available on Amazon to make this surgery easy if your SIM does not have a nano-sized \"pop out\" as most modern SIMs now do.) The phone immediately worked for voice calls. I had to manually adjust APN (Access Point Name) settings to get mobile data and MMS texting to work. (I used the same settings that were already on my own Google Nexus 5X. These settings can be found online for H2O Wireless and other mobile providers.) So far, the phone is working fine. Apps are fast enough for her - she is NOT a gamer - and the screen is beautiful. Keep in mind that my wife only turns the phone on when she is \"out & about\" then turns it off while she is home. I can't comment about whether there are problems after the phone has been running for a couple of days or even may hours without a restart. With such intermittent usage, the phone only needs to be charged once or twice a week. My wife does enjoy getting her Yahoo and Outlook mail on the phone and she finally has a good selection of apps, although she has little interest in most of them. She does like having AccuWeather. BOTTOM LINE: Good deal, especially for a light user.","rid":"f2be2f0bfd2cbde456a37a2fee35e150a373ad142e3f221c7c3c88618ca3ceee","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.5291018486,"neutral_prob":0.0000014913,"positive_prob":0.4708966911,"confidence_score":0.5291018486,"entropy":0.9975842237,"uncertainty_score":0.7086444497,"label":["1"],"Comments":[]}

{"id":2450,"text":"I'll update this as my experience increases.  I'm still in the installation phase, and there are two issues I've experienced.  Not necessarily product defects, but design considerations for the user:<br \/><br \/>There are 2 magnets in this product.

They are installed such that they are opposite polarity, and lock the device into place on the arm.  I had hoped to use this with magnetic holders in my car as well.  Unfortunately, only one of the magnets can be reversed (the one in the adapter), and the other (the one on the arm) cannot, My bad luck is the magnet in my car holder is installed reverse from what I need, and it just pushes the adapter magnet away.  If I could reverse *both* the magnets in the Rokform, they could all play together.<br \/><br \/>The second issue is that I planned to use this model on two bikes.  Both have 0 degree rise stems, so the fixed angle of the mount shouldn't be an issue.  Unfortunately, the handlebar clamp on one bike is pretty bulky, and interferes with the arm.  The product does come with 2 spacers, but they are insufficient to clear the clamp.  I'll have to get the adjustable model for the other bike.  Note that the way the 4 tab connector is mounted to the arm takes about 3\/8\" or space under that arm.  Take this into consideration when ordering.","rid":"8e554394573bae0b867ee5d7dd4a926bc608b3c582362c563df86269c1c5e764","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.5167862177,"neutral_prob":0.0000387039,"positive_prob":0.4831751287,"confidence_score":0.5167862177,"entropy":0.9997692704,"uncertainty_score":0.7271779776,"label":["-1"],"Comments":[]}

I‚Äôm just a user not a pro, so no crazy time lapse video though whole charging. It is little over kill for a Apple product. But the non folding plugs are more stable in the outlet than folding ones. The Anker still gets warm when charging but GaN technology makes this cooler than say charging with AUKEY 18w, which is similar size. With most of them they start getting work at 15watts or higher.

{"id":1622,"text":"I needed a budget Android Smart Phone that was well built had good battery life and a useable version of Android. And the NOKIA 4.2 has all these things. Before I go any further with this review I need to clarify a few things. I did not need or want a phone to play music all day, stream movies or play games. I needed one that was a good phone send a few texts get onto the internet when I needed to and maybe take a picture now or then. This phone can also do those other things. But will it be as good as a 1,000.00 high end smart phone probably not. But if you are looking for an entry level unlocked smart phone for 189.00 it is probably one of the best. The way I use my phone it is very reliable and has fantastic battery life. And even better the only software on it when you get it is Android version 9. This is the first android phone that I have ever owned that I can truly say is easy to use. There is no bloatware and no one has screwed up the interface. The only thing you are going to find on this phone is what you put there. The one thing I do not like is I would like to be able to make it go loader when on speaker phone. I have not done any streaming or music with it. So you will have to find a different review for that. But if you are looking for a good phone to get you through your day this is it.","rid":"212ffd2fbfab2f124a79b03be15904bcfa9efc4cab481eb03619f3c2c1fc493b","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.3681865036,"neutral_prob":0.3603962064,"positive_prob":0.27141729,"confidence_score":0.3681865036,"entropy":1.5720136166,"uncertainty_score":0.948818922,"label":["-1"],"Comments":[]}

The problem with this case is that it has a front, clear cover attached to the back and the rubber piece that covers the hard back and then the hard clip piece that snaps onto the rubber back piece.  Once I got all of that put together and on my Moto phone, I found that you can't access the phone's screen!!!  Meaning, if the phone rings, you can't answer it, you can't open apps...you'd have to completely disassemble this case to get to your phone and if that's not bad enough, a Moto phone with a mod...couldn't use any of the mods without taking this case completely off as well.

{"id":2430,"text":"My first experience trying to set this up was awful. Thankfully I was meeting my family for dinner before beginning my full trip, and so got the chance to fix this, but upon first clicking in the vent hook, it was very flimsy. I wasn't able to hook it to the vent on the right side since that vent was too close to the gear shift.<br \/>I tried tightening things, but after putting my phone in, the weight caused the grip to slip and halfway there the whole thing fell on the car floor. It's a pretty short grip, and even though it takes a lot of effort to open, the tension alone isn't enough depending on where in the vent it's hooked. Since then, I've had to take special care to try to find whatever \"sweet spot\" will work and actually support the weight of the phone in the vents, but I was hoping for a little more flexibility than this product supplies.<br \/>I haven't tried the suction option, but I don't have much faith in those in general, as they require a smooth surface to work.","rid":"9912dc0ad058e0b8b8ff25a0975e8b04e7323b8414d1efd9be488a1b6991a7b9","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.5420491099,"neutral_prob":0.0025257242,"positive_prob":0.4554252326,"confidence_score":0.5420491099,"entropy":1.0174748898,"uncertainty_score":0.6877226233,"label":["0"],"Comments":[]}

We used them every day, but did not use them in a way that would justify them acting like they had been bent at the end a lot.  one was in the car and one was in the living room and one was in a bedroom.  one by one they each failed to charge unless you held the end in the port just right.  Since micro-usb chargers are getting more difficult to find in the store, we keep ordering them from Amazon.  But I'm sick of them failing so fast and vow to right my reviews every time one fails.  Eventually maybe we will find a brand\/company that sells quality.  I'd like to get at least a year out of a charging cable... longer should be the norm, but I know that daily useage with teens is serious wear and tear, so give me a year of working and I won't complain too much.","rid":"815244f6e2ecee71e1b6d6d902a9bfcf478e8983111aa1a648fc3650693d67dd","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.9999953508,"neutral_prob":0.0000043679,"positive_prob":0.0000002836,"confidence_score":0.9999953508,"entropy":0.0000906409,"uncertainty_score":0.0000070424,"label":["-1"],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1807,"text":"The watch looks good, but the Amazon advertisement said it may include generic accessories, OK that fine, it didn't say it may not include everything it is supposed to and it doesn't. It is supposed to include: Galaxy Watch, Additional Strap(Large and Small included), Wireless charging Dock, Travel Adaptor, Quick Start Guide, User Manual (Warranty: 1 Year Standard Parts and Labor). The charger is generic, that's fine,  but no extra band, no wall charger and most importantly no manual, (yes you can download it, but I don't want to read it on a computer screen). Additionally, it only has a 90 day warranty as opposed to 1 year for the new watch. Price difference between the brand new with all original OEM accessories and warranty versus the renewed unit $63.57. I called Amazon and they were less than helpful. They are unable to do anything about it except offer a refund, which means now I have to spend my time and energy boxing it back up, not to mention returning the other accessories I bought, (screen protector, bands etc), what a pain. I thought the whole point of \"AMAZON\" renewed is that Amazon oversees this process to make sure we the customer don't get ripped off, they obviously don't. Save yourself the headache and just pay the additional  cost for the new unit at least until Amazon steps up their game and \"actually\" oversees the Amazon Renewed process.","rid":"6917c8e26805b8dd76851faccf42356a9eb31f38019bfb8839bcc9fec29d6fde","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.5432071686,"neutral_prob":0.0442884117,"positive_prob":0.4125044644,"confidence_score":0.5432071686,"entropy":1.2043973207,"uncertainty_score":0.6919330359,"label":["-1"],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1876,"text":"My criteria for a wireless charging mount for my car was fairly simple. It needed to quick charge my Galaxy S10e, have automatic arms, and have a ball joint. This mount had all that. I was pleased upon first few uses. My phone registered it as quick charging, I had converted the vent mount into a CD slot mount, and it held my phone well. A great bonus was the USB C plug included and its feature to plug the mount's charger straight underneath the mount instead of on the side like some other competing products. Unfortunately why I am giving it 3 stars is because the automatic arm feature was good in theory but I am realizing its poor execution and its ball joint loosens very easily. Another reviewer also encountered this problem: when needing to adjust the navigation map or switch songs on the phone, it is very easy to touch the buttons to open up the arms. Very easy. The phone ends up being loose and can fall out in a split second. This is the biggest annoyance and the main reason why I entertained the idea of returning this charging mount. I understand that it may get some getting used to, but as of now, I'm still encountering problems. Also, if you turn off your car before removing your phone, the arms will not loosen and you may have to forcefully pull your phone out or turn on your car again and press the button to release your phone. Again, this is something to get used to, but still an annoyance. The ball joint loosens easily. I find myself having to retighten it first thing every day when I get into my car. I'm afraid of its durability and longevity when I have to keep doing this. Overall it is a product that does as described, but not always very well. I have had no problems with charging, fortunately. I debated returning this mount for another, but as of now, I'm hoping that I'll get used to its flaws and work around them because I believe it has the potential to be a great charging mount.<br \/><br \/>Update<br \/>After owning this mount for a week the buttons to open the arms no longer work. Although this shows the poor quality and durability of this product, I have to be honest and say that this has been an improved to its functionality. No more accidental button pressing that may cause my phone to fall out of the mount.","rid":"74e2f1a8216fcfefe5f0c2d7eabc24d45e767ae248a34914dd24bdf8c92507ea","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.5168147683,"neutral_prob":0.0011949342,"positive_prob":0.4819903076,"confidence_score":0.5168147683,"entropy":1.0112533569,"uncertainty_score":0.7319113016,"label":["-1"],"Comments":[]}

I also had no intenions of using it for true VR purposes, only to view movies and tv in a more sumbersive way, which is why i was so happy to find something at such an affordable price. I had no idea that the viewing would be so rough. I used the adjusters under the goggles to try and center the image and make it clear, but unfortunately it just doesn't work. Both sides are blending in the center and it makes it too hard to see and it gave me a headache. I'm not sure if this headset is only meant for children or what but its just not meant for adult eyes.

{"id":1919,"text":"Used for 3 months on GSM system. This card is good value for the money. Cheaper than what you will find at any other overseas location. However a couple of drawbacks.  You first have to authorise the card and wait for a key to be delivered to the phone. This MAY TAKE 24 HOURS.  So plan accordingly..  Once activated, it works in MOST places but in SOME countries it has a hard time finding the right networks to use.  I crossed many borders between England, Ireland, Scotland Portugal, Spain, Croatia, Greece, Czech. I spent 24 hours going and coming through DUBLIN and it never worked but did in other areas of Ireland. I had sync issues while crossing into Portugal and spain and in Greece. Everywhere else seemed to work ok.  You can not top off without having a UK credit card.  That is the biggest pain.  Most of the time it worked quickly other times it took 24 hours to sort itself out.  I bought three cards for three months. I would recommend purchase again just be aware of the time it takes for the phone and system to authorize the SIM.  I need to find a good way to recharge, but it may be cheaper just use another card.","rid":"b7189ca430a3d4e26a4d2692201cfeafc0408f66d85772524e8d7f74940d8546","sentiment_word":"positive","negative_prob":0.4816794693,"neutral_prob":0.0055612931,"positive_prob":0.5127592683,"confidence_score":0.5127592683,"entropy":1.043394804,"uncertainty_score":0.7668889165,"label":["0"],"Comments":[]}

It barely fit my iPhone 7 w\/o the case.  I tried to use it on Galaxy Note 9, slipped out after 5 minutes or so and my phone cracked. This case works fine with Galaxy Note 9 with a case.

{"id":3341,"text":"I bought this cable at the end of 2015 and just now find myself needing a replacement. The actual cable itself is decent quality, however after just a few months, plastic pieces on the edge of the USB-C connecter broke off. The cable still worked with no issues so it was not a big deal. It just did not have a perfect fit or connection. Fast forward to June 2018, the cable has trouble making contact with the charging terminal, so unfortunately charging goes off and on constantly. It is now so bad that it basically won't charge for longer than 5 minutes unless the phone is positioned just right.<br \/><br \/>I used this cable with a USB DC power adapter in very hot Texas weather. So needless to say it was very abused and used every single day. I am impressed that this cable lasted a little longer than two years, but the build quality of the USB-C connector was sub bar. I think this cable would be worth purchasing if you were just going to use it indoors.<br \/><br \/>All in all this cord is okay, but I believe there is much better products on the market in the same price range. I'd seriously recommend springing a few extra clams and going for a higher quality USB-C cable. It's most definitely worth it.<br \/><br \/>At this point in time I would not recommend this cable to anyone, but it did fare well against abuse for at least 2 years. The connectors unfortunately were poorly made.","rid":"c04f504916360a14d76b36ca88eca306f40a9b45131e9815256eab724223df28","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.9998543262,"neutral_prob":0.0000096308,"positive_prob":0.0001360336,"confidence_score":0.9998543262,"entropy":0.0021178131,"uncertainty_score":0.0002292821,"label":["-1"],"Comments":[]}

{"id":2656,"text":"I've been strictly Blackberry since at least 2006 when I tried the first iPhone for a month (happily sent it back even back then).  My last Blackberry was the KeyOne which I've had since it first came out. Seems like the Blackberry that you have starts acting up as soon as the newest model is released. I'd  been having  usage issues ever since the Key2 was released. It mysteriously got better about a month ago, I presume once they worked out the compatibility kinks. Well I guess my hubby got tired of me witching about my phone and bought me one for my birthday. I've only been using the phone for two days thus far and am happy that he got it for me. I love my KeyOne but the Key2 is growing on me; even with the small noticeable changes from the KeyOne.<br \/><br \/>Right off the bat, I dang near broke the metal key to open up the sim card slot.I expected it to pop out and welcome my sim card but my first memory was hoping that me probing the key into the hole wasn't doing any damage. When I finally got the little door to crack open, I pried it open with my fingernail and placed my Sim and miniSD card. Transferring files from my KeyOne to the Key2 couldn't have been any easier. I have small lady hands so I find it easier to use one-handed. The keyboard does remind me of the earlier generations where the KeyOne felt kind of sticky on the keys. The power button was moved to the right side of the phone which I wish I knew why - just something new that I have to get used to. Taking screen shots feels awkward. The few pictures that I took didn't seem to bad but I need to take more before I form an opinion on this.<br \/><br \/>The reason that I'm writing the review is because of the speaker? I actually prefer the Key2 speaker to the KeyOne. The clarity is clearer to me; it sounds like you are listening to live music. Using the headphones that come with the phone gives that deeper base sound that may be lacking from the phone's speaker. The 64GB is boss! Not to mention the expansion slot for the memory card. I have so many pictures that have been transferred from phone to phone and this is a small problem that I need to clean up to save space hence the miniSD card. I didn't think the call quality was very good with the KeyOne and am still undecided on the Key2.<br \/><br \/>The Key2 uses pin passwords again where the KeyOne, I was using a pattern; not sure if its available on the Key2 but I'm glad that its set up that way. I declined the fingerprint feature on both phones. The marriage with Google has gotten better and apps function great. This is a limited review of the non technical stuff and I'm glad my hubby bought it for me when I was hanging on to the KeyOne as the last great Blackberry. I was sure they weren't going to be making any more phones. I currently have 6 BB phones. I wish I would of kept them all  instead of turning them in. They've turned into collector's items for me.","rid":"deed1fd12108ab66909af0600a3da3d3d3d0965e8fdddeab7df798e4749ab06d","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.5234391093,"neutral_prob":0.0000013764,"positive_prob":0.4765595198,"confidence_score":0.5234391093,"entropy":0.9984415174,"uncertainty_score":0.7500795126,"label":["1"],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1591,"text":"[[VIDEOID:7b303770a693fe1ccb75e6c33e2ba3f1]] I love this watch band. It is nice quality, very shiny and pretty, and I‚Äôve gotten tons of compliments everywhere I go. The band itself feels sturdy and it has a little weight to it that feels secure.<br \/>However, when I first received the band, I was expecting the butterfly clasp to be a benefit to securing it together. The one I received, the clasp was so loose that both sides kept coming undone while i was wearing it. I would be in the middle of talking (with arm gestures) and it would fly open and almost off my wrist. This is why I removed one star. I thought about returning it for a new one, but opted to search the web on how to tighten the clasp. After that it was perfect, very secure, and served its exact purpose, until....<br \/>I expected this watch band to be stainless steel, as described. True stainless steel is typically what I have to wear because I‚Äôm allergic to other metals. Today marks 2 weeks of having this band, and 4 days after tightening the clasp that I can actually wear it correctly and all the time, and my wrist is breaking out. But it‚Äôs only breaking out to the clasp piece, not the rest of the band. I thought maybe the clasp itself wasn‚Äôt stainless steel, until I realized that the clasp itself SAYS ‚Äústainless steel‚Äù directly on it. So this is why I removed another star.<br \/>I‚Äôm not sure what I plan to do in this case. I can try clear nail polish, but as with everything needing coated, it wears off rather quickly and I have to keep reapplying it about every week. So I‚Äôm not sure if it would be worth it and I‚Äôm considering returning the band for my personal lack of being able to wear it.<br \/>Anyone who doesn‚Äôt have an issue with allergies to metals, this band is fantastic and definitely 5 stars.","rid":"e1f088f4400d7035b221a5c1f33d3d354fc5a6d81334b2c6e03d4b0fc446cd65","sentiment_word":"positive","negative_prob":0.4606322348,"neutral_prob":0.0017386967,"positive_prob":0.5376291275,"confidence_score":0.5376291275,"entropy":1.0124192238,"uncertainty_score":0.727745235,"label":["0"],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1627,"text":"Charger does what it says, under ideal conditions.<br \/><br \/>It will in fact fast charge your phone wirelessly even through a case, provided you have a good enough power adapter (it should put out at least 2.4-3A) and you get the positioning right which seems to be very temperamental.<br \/><br \/>The coil must be very small because charging performance varies WIDELY based on even tiny adjustments to the position of the phone.  If the phone is not precisely aligned charging output is very poor, ranging from 450mA all the way down to as low as 30mA.  With absolutely perfect alignment charging output can exceed 1.2A which is about the most you can ask from a wireless car charger and is more than enough to be considered wireless fast charging.  The only problem is, it's hard to get that position right every time and unless you check the charging output with something like Ampere every time you may not notice you are charging slowly until you get a notification or notice that your battery is still going down.  You would think the automated grip would keep the alignment consistent but apparently not.<br \/><br \/>Also, keep in mind that with you phone attached this thing is heavy and it will make your vent point down and the bottom of the charger will rest on the dash.  This may not be an issue but if you need the phone to point at an upward or even straight forward angle, this is not for you.<br \/><br \/>The next biggest issue is the release buttons.  They are touch sensitive which seems nice until you realize they are on both sides of the mount and the position of the one on the right is right where your finger generally rests when you are trying to use the phone with your right hand (at least for me).  Even with multiple different angles I am constantly touching the button by accident and almost causing my phone to fall off the dash.  There should either be only one button on the left side or the back, or they shouldn't be touch sensitive.  This is a flawed design.  I plan to rectify this by putting a small piece of electrical tape over the right button but this shouldn't be necessary.<br \/><br \/>Overall it's a neat charger with a cool party trick that will impress your passenger and entertain you at least the first few times you use it.  It has some relatively big design setbacks but it also doesn't cost more than most other wireless chargers and allows you to mount it on the vent to prevent overheating which is the main reason I purchased it, and so far it has not overheated once.  This would be a 5 star device if they fixed the button and maybe made the coil a little bigger so positioning wasn't such an issue.","rid":"1788076eb3b027a08cd0a0af3600091f2871f5a0d6ca95484a88896cbdf72d86","sentiment_word":"neutral","negative_prob":0.4757335484,"neutral_prob":0.5240737796,"positive_prob":0.0001926319,"confidence_score":0.5240737796,"entropy":1.0007760525,"uncertainty_score":0.7490805387,"label":["0"],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1631,"text":"With a screen protector, you mainly don't want any surprises, and this one did just that. The instructional videos were a bit less instructional than I would have liked - all visual, nothing spoken - but they got the job done.<br \/><br \/>Installation was like any other screen protector, although they did include little stickers to line up the protector where you want it before you permanently attach it. This is a really simple and cheap way to get a more accurate install. Alcohol pads were slightly dry, and I ended up using all 3 to clean my screen, but that's probably my fault for using the device with my greasy fingers for a full week before adding a protector. The adhesive process was super simple and easy, and anyone who's put on a screen protector before should have no issues.<br \/><br \/>As far as performance after installation, you'd hardly know it's on the phone. I have no bubbles, it does not affect my touch screen in any way, and everything lines up properly with the speaker, front-facing camera, etc. I had slight rainbowing at extreme angles upon installation, but they went away after a few hours. This is among the most hassle-free and functional screen protectors I've ever purchased.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE: Unfortunately, I have to lower my rating to 3 stars. After moderate use of this screen protector, the touch sensitivity is declining, and it's getting harder to get a touch to register near the edges of the screen. I'm sure normal cell users won't find this to be a big issue, as it's not (yet) severe - but I'm a gamer, and I can't afford touches not registering. I ended up taking it off last night because it was getting a bit too frustrating for me, and I don't plan on reapplying. That said, I'm only lowering to 3 stars because it's easy to install, protects the screen well, looks nice, and should still be acceptable to some\/most people.","rid":"d8b36414bf8cde3c4e72a7c14c924651a24e81c3cda4c2175d6f907e45c67c9c","sentiment_word":"positive","negative_prob":0.3753948808,"neutral_prob":0.1068879291,"positive_prob":0.5177171826,"confidence_score":0.5177171826,"entropy":1.367139101,"uncertainty_score":0.7590854764,"label":["0"],"Comments":[]}

{"id":3472,"text":"This is my 5th different brand of screen protector for my S8.  The beveled edge design makes it extremely difficult to find a screen protector that will hold up to normal use and has made it difficult to find one that works with my case AND stays put without bubbles, cracks or peeling.  I did the installation correctly and have used the IQ Shield on my S8 almost 2 weeks now.  It appears to cover right to the edges of my phone case perfectly without pushing the screen protector up.  The sensitivity is great, but it's not as clear as other protectors I've used.  I can definitely tell I have a screen protector on.  Unfortunately, just this morning, I noticed that the edge is bubbling up now.  The S8 has a side tab for easy app access that requires you to swipe in from the beveled edge in order to get it to appear.  I've noticed that the edge of the screen protector is now bubbling exactly where I have to swipe to get it to appear and am assuming that utilizing this feature as much as I do has created a weak point in the adhesive right where my tab is located and has now allowed dust particles to get between the screen and the protector and bubbled.  Boo.  I'll be contacting customer support for a replacement or trying yet another brand.","rid":"a9bbcf2a27029f6e42fb1a88f356721fe4e4e24655d5ed7ac09ab196108d610d","sentiment_word":"positive","negative_prob":0.2240032107,"neutral_prob":0.2632245421,"positive_prob":0.5127722621,"confidence_score":0.5127722621,"entropy":1.4844770432,"uncertainty_score":0.7471814752,"label":["-1"],"Comments":[]}

They just have a big soft nub of rubber and when you are working on a small screen as on a 7-inch tablet or a phone it will pick two letters or two numbers at the time on a virtual keyboard. I have gone crazy looking for something with a tinier stylus tip and this looked good. I thought if this worked out I would buy another for my husband, who is constantly complaining that his stylus tip is too large.<br \/><br \/>In general I like this. I charged it overnight, then unplugged, turned it on and it worked without me needing to twist the tip to adjust the signal. It works on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 4, both 7\" and 10\" versions, and also on my Pixel phone (and that is such a temperamental little twit that a lot of things don't work with it). Sadly, the stylus doesn't seem to work as well on my touch-screen Acer Windows laptop, but I have only tried it in one program that was not made for use with a pen. It might work on another app better.<br \/><br \/>I've only been using it to read magazines and do some cleanup work on files on my tablet, so I haven't explored it totally. I tried downloading a drawing program on the 10\" tablet, but the pen didn't work that well, but the app wasn't rated that well, either, and it didn't work that well with my normal stylus, either. I did find if I used it while I was reading and didn't turn pages fast enough, it goes into standby mode and then I wonder why it's not working until I realize the light is not on. I need to test it further on something like an app that lets you use handwriting input.<br \/><br \/>What I really, really dislike about this stylus is that there is no way to fasten it to ANYTHING. It has no clip so you can clip it to your pocket or to your tablet case, or a ring so you can put a \"leash\" on it. It's not even magnetic. If I gave one to my husband he would promptly lose it! What's with the no clip or no method of keeping it leashed??? Even a cheap Bic pen has a clip!<br \/><br \/>====================================================<br \/><br \/>I charged this via a USB plug. I noticed immediately that the charging cord plug does not go all the way into the stylus; there is still a sixteenth of an inch of the charging cord plug showing. It went from red to blue and charged all night. But when I took it off the charger and pressed the button to turn it on, there was no light. I take it a light is supposed to come on when you press the button and will stay on until the battery runs down and it will turn red. I get no light at all.<br \/><br \/>I was really looking forward to this. Did I do something wrong? Was overnight (12 hours) too short to charge it? Is it because the mini-USB plug does not go all the way in the pen? I have tried all ways pressing the button.<br \/><br \/>Is there any way to get one that WORKS????","rid":"b4568d32ce6fd70c117acc0efa0775b7d766d133898e91532bd638bdcd4ec3f7","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.5217441916,"neutral_prob":0.0000000399,"positive_prob":0.4782557487,"confidence_score":0.5217441916,"entropy":0.9986363649,"uncertainty_score":0.7334226966,"label":["-1"],"Comments":[]}

I haven't intentionally tested out the waterproofing or accidentally tried to drown my phone since I got this case, but it is definitely shock-proof. One thing is, and it is probably an issue with all the waterproof cases, it can be hard for callers to hear me without the headphones. I have found out that if I open the USB input tab and the headphone tab and put the phone on speaker, talk loudly into the microphone, people I'm talking to can hear me. For a longer conversation, the headphone works best. I had considered returning it at first, but then I came to understand this issue is the same with any waterproof case.

One thing is, and it is probably an issue with all the waterproof cases, it can be hard for callers to hear me without the headphones. I have found out that if I open the USB input tab and the headphone tab and put the phone on speaker, talk loudly into the microphone, people I'm talking to can hear me. For a longer conversation, the headphone works best. I had considered returning it at first, but then I came to understand this issue is the same with any waterproof case.

{"id":3522,"text":"This is my 5th different brand of screen protector for my S8.  The beveled edge design makes it extremely difficult to find a screen protector that will hold up to normal use and has made it difficult to find one that works with my case AND stays put without bubbles, cracks or peeling.  I did the installation correctly and have used the IQ Shield on my S8 almost 2 weeks now.  It appears to cover right to the edges of my phone case perfectly without pushing the screen protector up.  The sensitivity is great, but it's not as clear as other protectors I've used.  I can definitely tell I have a screen protector on.  Unfortunately, just this morning, I noticed that the edge is bubbling up now.  The S8 has a side tab for easy app access that requires you to swipe in from the beveled edge in order to get it to appear.  I've noticed that the edge of the screen protector is now bubbling exactly where I have to swipe to get it to appear and am assuming that utilizing this feature as much as I do has created a weak point in the adhesive right where my tab is located and has now allowed dust particles to get between the screen and the protector and bubbled.  Boo.  I'll be contacting customer support for a replacement or trying yet another brand.","rid":"a9bbcf2a27029f6e42fb1a88f356721fe4e4e24655d5ed7ac09ab196108d610d","sentiment_word":"positive","negative_prob":0.2240032107,"neutral_prob":0.2632245421,"positive_prob":0.5127722621,"confidence_score":0.5127722621,"entropy":1.4844770432,"uncertainty_score":0.7471814752,"label":["-1"],"Comments":[]}

{"id":3640,"text":"My original review of this is below. I received a stylus that did not work. I contacted Vine about this and they sent me a new one immediately. Thank you, Vine personnel!<br \/><br \/>The reason I wanted to try this one is that most styluses are so clumsily tipped! They just have a big soft nub of rubber and when you are working on a small screen as on a 7-inch tablet or a phone it will pick two letters or two numbers at the time on a virtual keyboard. I have gone crazy looking for something with a tinier stylus tip and this looked good. I thought if this worked out I would buy another for my husband, who is constantly complaining that his stylus tip is too large.<br \/><br \/>In general I like this. I charged it overnight, then unplugged, turned it on and it worked without me needing to twist the tip to adjust the signal. It works on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 4, both 7\" and 10\" versions, and also on my Pixel phone (and that is such a temperamental little twit that a lot of things don't work with it). Sadly, the stylus doesn't seem to work as well on my touch-screen Acer Windows laptop, but I have only tried it in one program that was not made for use with a pen. It might work on another app better.<br \/><br \/>I've only been using it to read magazines and do some cleanup work on files on my tablet, so I haven't explored it totally. I tried downloading a drawing program on the 10\" tablet, but the pen didn't work that well, but the app wasn't rated that well, either, and it didn't work that well with my normal stylus, either. I did find if I used it while I was reading and didn't turn pages fast enough, it goes into standby mode and then I wonder why it's not working until I realize the light is not on. I need to test it further on something like an app that lets you use handwriting input.<br \/><br \/>What I really, really dislike about this stylus is that there is no way to fasten it to ANYTHING. It has no clip so you can clip it to your pocket or to your tablet case, or a ring so you can put a \"leash\" on it. It's not even magnetic. If I gave one to my husband he would promptly lose it! What's with the no clip or no method of keeping it leashed??? Even a cheap Bic pen has a clip!<br \/><br \/>====================================================<br \/><br \/>I charged this via a USB plug. I noticed immediately that the charging cord plug does not go all the way into the stylus; there is still a sixteenth of an inch of the charging cord plug showing. It went from red to blue and charged all night. But when I took it off the charger and pressed the button to turn it on, there was no light. I take it a light is supposed to come on when you press the button and will stay on until the battery runs down and it will turn red. I get no light at all.<br \/><br \/>I was really looking forward to this. Did I do something wrong? Was overnight (12 hours) too short to charge it? Is it because the mini-USB plug does not go all the way in the pen? I have tried all ways pressing the button.<br \/><br \/>Is there any way to get one that WORKS????","rid":"b4568d32ce6fd70c117acc0efa0775b7d766d133898e91532bd638bdcd4ec3f7","sentiment_word":"negative","negative_prob":0.5217441916,"neutral_prob":0.0000000399,"positive_prob":0.4782557487,"confidence_score":0.5217441916,"entropy":0.9986363649,"uncertainty_score":0.7334226966,"label":["-1"],"Comments":[]}
